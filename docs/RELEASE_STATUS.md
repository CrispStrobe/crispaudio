# Distribution and platform status — 2026-10-08

Pushing `main` runs CI/web deployment workflows and the unsigned iOS simulator
check. It does **not** automatically
submit an iOS or macOS build to Apple. No release tag or Apple upload was triggered
for the October interview features or touch workflow changes.

| Route | Trigger | Current evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop GitHub bundles | `v*` tag or `release.yml` dispatch | macOS ARM, Windows, Linux jobs configured |
| iOS App Store Connect upload | `v*` tag or `ios-release.yml` dispatch with dry run off | Last run Aug 17 succeeded, including upload step; not independently checked against ASC processing/review status in this audit |
| macOS App Store upload | `mac-v*` tag or `macos-release.yml` dispatch | Last Sep 13 run failed: invalid provisioning profile signature |
| Local macOS testing | local Tauri build | Installed ad-hoc-signed `~/Applications/CrispAudio-local.app`; not an Apple-distributed release |

Evidence: [iOS workflow run](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/crispaudio/actions/runs/32039732193),
[macOS failed run](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/crispaudio/actions/runs/34760697731).
A successful upload step is not proof of Apple processing success, TestFlight
availability, review approval, or public release. Those states need an ASC check.
Note that a generic `v*` release tag also triggers the iOS upload workflow.

## Features by platform

| Capability | Local desktop | iOS/iPadOS | Browser |
|---|---|---|---|
| SFX, voice tools, audio timeline | Yes | Existing mobile implementation | Yes, subject to browser codecs |
| Touch clip actions, mixer, scrubber | Yes | Shared frontend; device validation pending | Yes |
| Automatic Canon/H6 synchronization | Installed FFmpeg/FFprobe required | No | No |
| Video preview + edited MP4 remux | Desktop only | No | No |
| Linked interview project paths | Local desktop | Mac paths inaccessible | No |
| Portable audio project | Yes | Embedded audio | Embedded audio |

## Remaining release gates

- Test the shared editor on actual iPhone and iPad: portrait/landscape, Files,
  export/share, VoiceOver, audio interruptions, foreground/background transitions,
  and memory use with the intended interview length.
- For a complete mobile interview product, implement in-process/native media
  extraction, correlation input, production resampling, video preview, and MP4
  composition/export. Do not expose desktop subprocess commands as working iOS
  features. Add security-scoped media persistence/relocation and a streaming cache.
- For macOS App Store, fix signing/profile validation and validate sandbox file
  access. The Homebrew FFmpeg dependency of the local app has not been established
  as a usable Mac App Store deployment strategy. Bundle/integrate an appropriate
  licensed media implementation before advertising that workflow in the store.
- Check current main CI before tagging. Verify Apple builds in ASC after upload.

See [the interview walkthrough](INTERVIEW_WALKTHROUGH.md) for the working desktop
workflow and the current iOS audio-only preparation/edit/remux workflow.

## Local verification of the October touch changes

Frontend lint/build and 1,147 tests pass. The macOS app was rebuilt and its local
ad-hoc signature verified. Browser workflow checks passed at 375×667, 390×844,
844×390, 1024×768, and 1440×1000, including microphone import/switching, common
splits, seeking, inspector dialogs, touch selection vs. deliberate arrangement,
and undo. The guided desktop setup used mocked native IPC with real excerpt WAV
decoding/video preview; this is not a native dialog/IPC end-to-end test.
No native screenshot capture was repeated after the WindowServer crash.

## Local visual timeline build 0.4.0

Installed and launched `~/Applications/CrispAudio-local.app` with the prepared
MVI_8251 project. Both bundle version fields now read 0.4.0. No Apple upload or
release tag was triggered.

Added a larger/fullscreen viewer, approximate 33 ms seeking, shared-clock video
filmstrip, normalized waveforms and a two-mic alignment inspection overlay.
One source video is locked to its original clock; a persisted, undoable in/out
range exports a single section. Multiple video clips/multicam remain future work.
Desktop FFmpeg is still required; these video features are not available on iOS.

Validation: 1,154 frontend tests, lint/build, 16 native Rust tests and six media
Rust tests pass. Generated-media integration checks cover accurate section first
picture, duration and both audio alternatives, plus invalid ranges/short mixes.
The GUI trimmed-mix backend path has a regression test preventing a second seek.
Full-length compressed video/camera audio hashes still match. Browser checks
cover five touch/desktop viewports; the desktop IPC mock exercised real video
thumbnail generation, alignment comparison and range entry at MacBook size.
This does not establish native WebKit thumbnail or iOS device behavior. Local
native build/signature and process launch were verified without OS screen capture.
